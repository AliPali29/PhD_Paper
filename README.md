This repository supports the analysis of the project 'Informative censoring models for liver transplantation data' by Despina Konstantinidou for the degree of MSc Data Science & Statistics of the University of Bath.

The National Health Service of Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) gave permission on the liver transplantation data to the supervisor of the project, Dr. Karim Anaya-Izquierdo, for research and academic purposes. However the access to the data is limited and it cannot be provided in public.

'optimisation.Rmd' is the R markdown file for the non-covariate model estimates optimisation. This file includes the corresponfing log-likelihood and gradient functions to support the analysis.

'optimisation-covariates.Rmd' is the R markdown file for the covariate model estimates optimisation respectively.
